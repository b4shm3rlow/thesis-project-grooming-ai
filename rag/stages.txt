TARGETING
What Happens:
The predator identifies a vulnerable individual based on their emotional, social, or psychological needs.
They look for victims who may be isolated, struggling with self-esteem, or have family issues.
Can occur online, in schools, in social groups, or even within families.

Additional Signs:

Asking seemingly innocent personal questions to gauge vulnerabilities.
Showing a sudden interest in the victim’s hobbies or problems.
Positioning themselves as a mentor, friend, or someone who "understands" them.
Casual references to shared interests or mutual acquaintances to create a false sense of familiarity.

Building Trust
What Happens:

Additional Signs:

Engaging in frequent, private conversations (e.g., through text or social media).
Offering emotional support and portraying themselves as the only one who "truly understands" the victim.
Increasing physical or digital presence in the victim’s life (e.g., frequent texting or messaging).
Gaining the trust of parents or caregivers by appearing polite, responsible, and caring.


Filling a Need
What Happens:

They create a sense of obligation and dependence.
Can involve meeting a financial, social, or emotional need.
Additional Signs:

The victim suddenly has expensive or unusual new items (e.g., phones, clothing, video games).
The victim speaks highly of an older "friend" or mentor who helps them.
The predator encourages secrecy about their interactions or gifts.
Making grand promises about a better life, career opportunities, or special treatment.


 Isolation
What Happens:

The predator systematically removes the victim from their support system, making them more reliant on them.
Friends and family may be portrayed as uncaring, restrictive, or incapable of understanding.
The victim may begin to feel alienated and turn to the predator as their sole source of support.
Additional Signs:

The victim withdraws from social circles, stops engaging in usual activities, or avoids family events.
Sudden emotional changes, mood swings, or extreme defensiveness.
The predator reinforces negative beliefs about the victim’s family or friends (e.g., "They don’t love you like I do").
Making the victim feel guilty for spending time with others instead of them.
